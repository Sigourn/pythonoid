# pythonoid

My Arkanoid in Python project. Based off Arkanoid from the NES, a favorite of mine in my childhood days.

Only one level, however.

## Features

- Silver bricks! They take an extra hit to destroy.
- Ball changing direction depending on where it impacts your craft.
- Game over screen.
- Sounds, lifted straight off the NES original.

## How to play

Download the files and run **arkanoid.py**. It's that simple! It does require the **playsound** module though.
